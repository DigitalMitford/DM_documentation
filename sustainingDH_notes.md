# Working with Sustainability Roadmap: https://sites.haa.pitt.edu/sustainabilityroadmap/

## Module A1: 
### Site Index Workflow
1. Coders on the ground: tag named entities. Look up if they are in SI. If not, add. 
    * If problematic, write an update.
    * Known danger of producing duplicate entries.
  
2. @lmwilson and @ebeshero : Collect (harvest) and "dedupe" (merge duplicates), revise, and add to official SI for new releases of the SI.
    * We might want to start naming releases of the SI! 

3. @lmwilson and @ebeshero: Macro level cleanup of entries, standardization of notes, create basis for linked open data.

4. @ebeshero: publishing from SI on the website: (the way annotations are pulled into edition files, 
    * AND separate publications profiling significant names. (not currently delivered, but will be).

5. Lather, rinse, repeat--this is recursive. As we publish, we see issues to correct in the source code. We find duplicate entries, etc.

## Module A2
General notes: Digital projects
* fewer than 3 years 
* over 3 years with the expectation of eventual retirement
* "book time"-- as long as book would last? This is not necessarily the default. 

Phases: 
* **Active Creation**: The project is being created, developed, updated
* **Ongoing Maintenance**: regular, non-transformative activites to sustain the project are undertaken
* **Retirement**: proactive project management ends, with proactive removal OR graceful degradation
