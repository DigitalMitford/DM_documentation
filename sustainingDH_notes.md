# Working with [Sustainability Roadmap](https://sites.haa.pitt.edu/sustainabilityroadmap/)

## Module A1: 
### Site Index Workflow
1. Coders on the ground: tag named entities. Look up if they are in SI. If not, add. 
    * If problematic, write an update.
    * Known danger of producing duplicate entries.
  
2. @lmwilson and @ebeshero : Collect (harvest) and "dedupe" (merge duplicates), revise, and add to official SI for new releases of the SI.
    * We might want to start naming releases of the SI! 

3. @lmwilson and @ebeshero: Macro level cleanup of entries, standardization of notes, create basis for linked open data.

4. @ebeshero: publishing from SI on the website: (the way annotations are pulled into edition files, 
    * AND separate publications profiling significant names. (not currently delivered, but will be).

5. Lather, rinse, repeat--this is recursive. As we publish, we see issues to correct in the source code. We find duplicate entries, etc.

6. Invade wikipedia and ODNB etc with our rich data!

## Module A2
General notes: Digital projects
* fewer than 3 years 
* over 3 years with the expectation of eventual retirement
* "book time"-- as long as book would last? This is not necessarily the default. 

Phases: 
* **Active Creation**: The project is being created, developed, updated
* **Ongoing Maintenance**: regular, non-transformative activites to sustain the project are undertaken
* **Retirement**: proactive project management ends, with proactive removal OR graceful degradation

1) and 2) Cathedral scale. Letters are forever and SI , Lit editions more finite and less pressing. However, in 10-15 years the senior editors will start retiring. We need to package up the project to train up a new generation of scholar-coders on this project who will sustain the letters and SI activity. And we need to Teach and Document our work for that to happen. 

--Next generations may be to us as we are to Coles? Our interpretations will become dated. However, the data on named entities, document sources, etc should be stable, though software support will change.  

2) Lifespan why? Because economic (time), financial (no regular funding), intellectual (scale of edition projects)

3) "Mid-morning phase": 
* dawn was conceiving the project / writing the codebook
* now we're working out bugs, and publishing more things, changing the interface
* once literary modules are in development and SI encoding stabilized, it'll be "Noon": building on established precedents. 

4) Next phase of development: (maybe after 5 years)
* Take on a wider scale of years (not just 1819-1825, but moving backward + forward in time
* Writing for a big grant again. 

## Module A3: Who's visiting?

Who uses your project?

Why do they use it? what needs do they have?

What do you imagine they get out of it? 

General notes: we need to be aware of other coding projects looking to learn from us or link with us 

See ![our photo of post-it notes on our user communities](sustainingDH_photos/moduleA3_userGroups.jpg)

## Module A4 What are the project's sustainability priorities? 

* What is your project's narrative, argument, or mission? Where and how do your intellectual goals unfold?
    * Sidenote: We may be serving our "learn to code" audience more directly right now than the audience for MRM's writings
    * Intellectual goals unfolding in the classroom
    * Deans/admins might not have good sense of what our code means, or how our students are learning from this, or the activity going on behind the website view. 
    * Intellectual goals are unfolding in Box and GitHub--not seen on website b/c long in-progress cycle. 
    * Public presentations / conferences are one way of motivating stages that can be shared. 


* What information is your project intended to convey? How does it convey it?
    * Read MRM's writings
    * Finding MRM's papers (tabular publication)
    * Information about MRM's networks of people, places, documents
    * Information about 19th-century letter writing, how to read postmarks, etc
    * Incomplete conveyance, but some network graphing, some publishing of bibliographies and archival holdings, editions 

* How do you define your project's institutional context? What are its contours and features?
    * multiple institutions, connected as our own network.
    * Annual coding school, Box, e-mail, and social media keep us connected and in contact

* What are the structural components of your project?
    

* What about your project's chosen technologies and/or digital interactivity is most salient to you? What forms does it take? 


Significant Property |  Function on the Project | Designated Communities Served
----------------- | --------------------- |-------------------- |
Box Workspace | Workspace and teaching/research resources | **whole** project team
Site Index integration with editions | sharing new data about 19c contexts | builds linked open data, available knowledge on web 
Schema Code and Codebook | Manage and guide the code, ease selection of tags, provide examples | project team and other coders
oXygen XML Editor | syntax awareness, guiding the code | project team

public-facing website and eXist-db | publish our data, share code |  all our user groups, project team members' accreditation of work, proofreading  
Social Media 2: Blog / Listservs | Announcements, detailed posts about project process | reaches potential new editors, coding school participants, involves our students 
Social Media 3: Ancestry.com | public genealogy trees | finds people with overlapping research interests on historical people and places
GitHub repos | share and refine code, with version control | serves project and other coders

Social Media 1: Instagram / Twitter / Facebook | Popularize/ publicize | reaches librarians, archivisits/rare books fans


RANKINGS: We have organized the above properties from first to last in terms of their priorities to our project.

Eventually in course of this workshop, we'll be matching up user-groups with properties we list in A4.
