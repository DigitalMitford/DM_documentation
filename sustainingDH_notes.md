# Working with [Sustainability Roadmap](https://sites.haa.pitt.edu/sustainabilityroadmap/)

## Module A1: 
### Site Index Workflow
1. Coders on the ground: tag named entities. Look up if they are in SI. If not, add. 
    * If problematic, write an update.
    * Known danger of producing duplicate entries.
  
2. @lmwilson and @ebeshero : Collect (harvest) and "dedupe" (merge duplicates), revise, and add to official SI for new releases of the SI.
    * We might want to start naming releases of the SI! 

3. @lmwilson and @ebeshero: Macro level cleanup of entries, standardization of notes, create basis for linked open data.

4. @ebeshero: publishing from SI on the website: (the way annotations are pulled into edition files, 
    * AND separate publications profiling significant names. (not currently delivered, but will be).

5. Lather, rinse, repeat--this is recursive. As we publish, we see issues to correct in the source code. We find duplicate entries, etc.

6. Invade wikipedia and ODNB etc with our rich data!

## Module A2
General notes: Digital projects
* fewer than 3 years 
* over 3 years with the expectation of eventual retirement
* "book time"-- as long as book would last? This is not necessarily the default. 

Phases: 
* **Active Creation**: The project is being created, developed, updated
* **Ongoing Maintenance**: regular, non-transformative activites to sustain the project are undertaken
* **Retirement**: proactive project management ends, with proactive removal OR graceful degradation

1) and 2) Cathedral scale. Letters are forever and SI , Lit editions more finite and less pressing. However, in 10-15 years the senior editors will start retiring. We need to package up the project to train up a new generation of scholar-coders on this project who will sustain the letters and SI activity. And we need to Teach and Document our work for that to happen. 

--Next generations may be to us as we are to Coles? Our interpretations will become dated. However, the data on named entities, document sources, etc should be stable, though software support will change.  

2) Lifespan why? Because economic (time), financial (no regular funding), intellectual (scale of edition projects)

3) "Mid-morning phase": 
* dawn was conceiving the project / writing the codebook
* now we're working out bugs, and publishing more things, changing the interface
* once literary modules are in development and SI encoding stabilized, it'll be "Noon": building on established precedents. 

4) Next phase of development: (maybe after 5 years)
* Take on a wider scale of years (not just 1819-1825, but moving backward + forward in time
* Writing for a big grant again. 

## Module A3

Who uses your project?

Why do they use it? what needs do they have?

What do you imagine they get out of it? 

General notes: we need to be aware of other coding projects looking to learn from us or link with us
