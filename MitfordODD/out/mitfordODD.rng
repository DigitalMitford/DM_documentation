Haydon wrote: I find Sir William Allan only in the town, he is painting a very clever picture of The Broken Fiddle. A wooden-legged sailor has broken his fiddle on the head of a young scamp for some mischievous trick; an old woman, his granddam, is shaking her fist at the sailor, who is enjoying the pain of the crying boy. . . . It promises to be a very clever thing indeed. The background in colour and effect is the best thing he has done., as excerpted in Benjamin Robert Haydon: Correspondence and Table-Talk, Vol. 2, p. 74 . The painting was frequently mentioned by 1820s periodical writers as one of Allanâs best. In 1822, Blackwoodâs called it a piece of quite a different cast from anything he had formerly attempted. It is a highly humorous composition, and the glow of colouring is such as perhaps Wilkie himself never surpassed. Blackwoodâs Edinburgh Magazine, 11 (1822): p. 439 .) </a:documentation>

Haydon wrote: I find Sir William Allan only in the town, he is painting a very clever picture of The Broken Fiddle. A wooden-legged sailor has broken his fiddle on the head of a young scamp for some mischievous trick; an old woman, his granddam, is shaking her fist at the sailor, who is enjoying the pain of the crying boy. . . . It promises to be a very clever thing indeed. The background in colour and effect is the best thing he has done., as excerpted in Benjamin Robert Haydon: Correspondence and Table-Talk, Vol. 2, p. 74 . The painting was frequently mentioned by 1820s periodical writers as one of Allanâs best. In 1822, Blackwoodâs called it a piece of quite a different cast from anything he had formerly attempted. It is a highly humorous composition, and the glow of colouring is such as perhaps Wilkie himself never surpassed.

Haydon wrote: I find Sir William Allan only in the town, he is painting a very clever picture of The Broken Fiddle. A wooden-legged sailor has broken his fiddle on the head of a young scamp for some mischievous trick; an old woman, his granddam, is shaking her fist at the sailor, who is enjoying the pain of the crying boy. . . . It promises to be a very clever thing indeed. The background in colour and effect is the best thing he has done., as excerpted in Benjamin Robert Haydon: Correspondence and Table-Talk, Vol. 2, p. 74 . The painting was frequently mentioned by 1820s periodical writers as one of Allanâs best. In 1822, Blackwoodâs called it a piece of quite a different cast from anything he had formerly attempted. It is a highly humorous composition, and the glow of colouring is such as perhaps Wilkie himself never surpassed. Blackwoodâs Edinburgh Magazine, 11 (1822): p. 439 .) </a:documentation>
